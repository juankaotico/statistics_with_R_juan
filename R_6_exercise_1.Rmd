## Load KiGGS data

```{r}
dat_link <- url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/nbh0f6upejh7nr8/data.RData?dl=1")
load(dat_link)

# Alternative: download data from Moodle, either (i) the raw .sav dataset (SPSS data file) which you need to import, or (ii) the already imported .RData file with:
# load("/Users/skonigor/Desktop/data_Biostat2/KiGGS/KiGGS03_06.RData")
# (you need to adapt path)

dat <- KiGGS03_06
```

## Get subset of KiGGS data

Assume that the 17640 children in the KiGGS are our population. 

Let's mimick a study, draw a random sample of 100 children from this dataset, and compute the mean BMI of boys and girls in this sample.

```{r}

# how many observations are there?
dim(dat)
# ok, draw 100 numbers between 1 and 17640 randomly
idx <- sample(1:17640, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
# take these observations as subsample
dat_sample <- dat[idx, ]
# look at the BMI variable, if it is a numeric variable (it is)
str(dat_sample$bmiB)
str(dat_sample$sex)
# now compute the mean
mean(dat_sample$bmiB, na.rm = TRUE)
#mean per sex
mean(dat_sample$bmiB[dat_sample$sex == "Weiblich"], na.rm = TRUE)
mean(dat_sample$bmiB[dat_sample$sex == "MÃ¤nnlich"], na.rm = TRUE)





```

Are these mean BMI of boys and girls different, can you conclude this for the population?
