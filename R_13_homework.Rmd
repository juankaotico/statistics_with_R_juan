## Exercise 1: Survival analysis

Choose one other provided dataset in the survival package (or any other suitable dataset) which contains time-to-event data. Use the survfit function to compute the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function and plot it. Then choose a variable with 2 or more categories in the dataset and perform a log-rank test.
