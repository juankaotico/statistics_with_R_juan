Task: Download this R Markdown file, save it on your computer, and perform all the below tasks by inserting your answer in text or by inserting R chunks below. After you are done, upload this file with your solutions on Moodle.

# Exercise 1

**Task a**: Create an R chunk here to insert R code. Add R code in this R chunk to perform a simple calculation (e.g. calculate the sum of 1 and 2).

**Solution a**: R code can be inserted and executed into the R Markdown file here through R chunks. The start of such an R chunk in the document is specified by **\```\{r\}**, the end by **\```**, and inbetween R code can be inserted. For example, writing

\```\{r\}

1 + 2

\```

creates the following output in the knitted R Markdown file:

```{r}
1 + 2
```

**Task b**:

b) Create an R chunk with a basic calculation (e.g. 1+1). Try out the different ways how to include this in the knitted report (see lecture slides page 13).

**Solution b**:

First, lets insert an basic R chunk without further designation:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

This both shows the R code as well as the result in the knitted file. Underlying to this are the default settings eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, which can be written explicitely as well:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
1 + 1
```

Now setting eval = FALSE just shows the R code but doesn't compute results.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
1 + 1
```

On the other side, the option echo = FALSE doesn't show the R code but the computed output:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
1 + 1
```

## Exercise 2: Manipulating variables and data frames

**Task:** Load the Pima Indian dataset:

```{r}
dat_ex2 <- read.csv(file = url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/4s4rhf6abda6gw2/Pima_diabetes.csv?dl=1"))
```

and answer the following questions.

**Solutions:**

```{r}
# How many women have Glucose levels 0?
table(dat_ex2$Glucose == 0)

# How many women have Insulin levels 0?
table(dat_ex2$Insulin == 0)

# How many women have both Glucose levels as well as Insulin levels 0?
table((dat_ex2$Glucose == 0) & (dat_ex2$Insulin == 0))

# How many women have either Glucose levels or Insulin levels 0?
table((dat_ex2$Glucose == 0) | (dat_ex2$Insulin == 0))

# How many women have missing BMI values?
table(is.na(dat_ex2$BMI))

# How many women have BMI larger than 40?
table(dat_ex2$BMI > 40)

# Build a dataset that only includes the women with BMI>40
dat_BMI40 <- dat_ex2[dat_ex2$BMI > 40, ]

# Create a new variable named BMIOutlier, which has the value 0 if a women has BMI smaller or equal 50, and 1 if she has BMI higher than 50
# For this, first create the variable and set its values to 0 for everyone
dat_ex2$BMIOutlier <- 0
# then set it to 1 for those with BMI higher than 50
dat_ex2$BMIOutlier[dat_ex2$BMI > 50] <- 1

# check results
head(dat_ex2)
table(dat_ex2$BMIOutlier)

# Alternative way:
dat_ex2$BMIOutlier2 <- ifelse(dat_ex2$BMI > 50, 1, 0)

# check
table(dat_ex2$BMIOutlier)
table(dat_ex2$BMIOutlier, dat_ex2$BMIOutlier2)

```

## Exercise 3

**Task:** Explore merging two datasets.

As a preparation, do the following code to create 2 data.frames

```{r}
# import data
dat_ex3 <- read.csv(file = url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/4s4rhf6abda6gw2/Pima_diabetes.csv?dl=1"))

# extract two smaller data sets
dat3_1 <- dat_ex3[1:100, 1:3]
dat3_2 <- dat_ex3[101:300, 1:3]

dat3_3 <- dat_ex3[1:100, 1:3]
dat3_4 <- dat_ex3[1:100, 4:6]
```

**Task 3a:** Think about how you can use the [.] operator to respectively piece dat3_1 and dat3_2, and dat3_3 and dat3_4 together into one data frame.

**Solution:**

```{r}
# First, I want to create a new dataset dat3_12 which integrates dat3_1 and dat3_2, and adds the observations of dat3_2 (i.e. rows) below the rows of dat3_1

# One easy way how to do this directly is using the rbind() function:
dat3_12_vs1 <- rbind(dat3_1, dat3_2)
# similarly, dat3_3 and dat3_4 can be combined by adding the columns of dat3_4 to the columns of dat3_3 using the cbind() function:
dat3_34_vs1 <- cbind(dat3_3, dat3_4)

# The above are among the easiest ways how to do it, and what I would recommend. Alternatively you can also do it using the basic tools we have learned so far and using the [.] operator:
# first create the new data frame which will combine both files dat3_12_vs2, as a copy of dat3_1. then add the rows below using the [.] operator

dat3_12_vs2 <- dat3_1
dat3_12_vs2[101:300, ] <- dat3_2

# check if they are the same
all(dat3_12_vs1 == dat3_12_vs2)
# -> yes! :-)

# do the same to combine dat3_3 and dat3_4 and check:
dat3_34_vs2 <- dat3_3
dat3_34_vs2[, 4:6] <- dat3_4
all(dat3_34_vs1 == dat3_34_vs2)
```

**Task 3b:** Explore the help of the merge() function in R in order to achieve the same goal of combining dat3_3 and dat3_4 together into one data frame. Hint: first create an ID variable in each data frame, then use this in the "by" argument.

**Solution:**

```{r}
# look at help of the merge function
# ?merge

# try naive way
dat3_34_vs3 <- merge(dat3_3, dat3_4)
# -> hm ... 10000 observations of 6 variables ... that doesn't seem right. underlying this is that the merge functions uses the by argument to merge the variables/observations of two datasets based on that variable, which is assumed to be contained in both datasets. If such a variable is not present, the merge() function tries do something, which here doesn't make sense. 
# hence create such a common variable first, namely an ID variable which just numbers the observations
dat3_3$ID <- 1:100
dat3_4$ID <- 1:100

# have a look at what we have done:
head(dat3_3)
head(dat3_4)

# now merge again and check
dat3_34_vs3 <- merge(dat3_3, dat3_4, by = "ID")
head(dat3_34_vs3)
# -> looks good :-)
```

## Exercise 4 (optional): Times and dates in R

**Task:** Create an Excel file with 5 observations of 2 variables. Variable 1 is just an ID variable (number 1-5 or character string etc.), and variable 2 is a date/time variable. Use variable 2 to describe the time (and day) you had lunch in the last 5 days. Then try to import the Excel file with both variables into R and/or transform the variables in R to Date or POSIXct variables.

**Solution:**
Step 1: Create the Excel file. I have saved this file as **R_2_homework_ex4.xlsx**, and its content looks as follows:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Screenshot of entries in Excel file.", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/stefan.konigorski/Dropbox/@HPI/Teaching/0_R_Statistical_Epidemiology/1_WS201920/VL2/R_2_homework_ex4.JPG")
```

Step 2: Import Excel file into R, check it, and save it as Rdata file:

```{r}
#install.packages("readxl") 
# load package
library(readxl)
# import dataset
dat_ex4 <- read_excel("C:/Users/stefan.konigorski/Dropbox/@HPI/Teaching/0_R_Statistical_Epidemiology/1_WS201920/VL2/R_2_homework_ex4.xlsx", sheet = 1)

# check
head(dat_ex4) #-> looks good, but lunchtime is not yet recognized as a date/time variable, hence transform it.

# create new date/time variable
# Try the following at first:
# dat_ex4$lunchtime_transf <- as.POSIXct(dat_ex4$lunchtime) 

# -> this doesn't work right away; as.POSIXct() has several standard date/time formats that it tries, but my format is not among them, hence I have to tell the as.POSIXct() function explicitely how my date/time variable looks like using the format argument:

dat_ex4$lunchtime_transf <- as.POSIXct(dat_ex4$lunchtime, format = "%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%OS")
head(dat_ex4) 

# -> looks good :-) can you do some transformations with it?
dat_ex4$lunchtime_transf
dat_ex4$lunchtime_transf + 1

# save
save(dat_ex4, file = "C:/Users/stefan.konigorski/Dropbox/@HPI/Teaching/0_R_Statistical_Epidemiology/1_WS201920/VL2/R_2_homework_ex4.RData")
```
