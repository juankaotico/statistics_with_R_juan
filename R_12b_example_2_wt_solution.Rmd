## Overview

Use the Blackmore dataset in the car R package. It describes 138 girls with eating disorders and 98 girls from a control group, regarding their age and exercise behaviour.

Aim: Describe the exercise behaviour over time (age) and by the group.

```{r}
library(car)
data("Blackmore")
dat <- Blackmore

# Inspect dataset
str(dat)
summary(dat)

# Preparation
boxplot(exercise ~ group, data = dat) # exercise should be log-transformed
dat$log.exercise <- log(dat$exercise + 0.02) 
boxplot(log.exercise ~ group, data = dat, ylab="log(exercise)")

hist(dat$exercise)
hist(dat$log.exercise) 

# Do analyses
...

```
