## Load KiGGS data

```{r}
dat_link <- url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/nbh0f6upejh7nr8/data.RData?dl=1")
load(dat_link)

# Alternative: download data from Moodle, either (i) the raw .sav dataset (SPSS data file) which you need to import, or (ii) the already imported .RData file with:
# load("/Users/skonigor/Desktop/data_Biostat2/KiGGS/KiGGS03_06.RData")
# (you need to adapt path)

dat <- KiGGS03_06
```

## Get subset of KiGGS data

Assume that the 17640 children in the KiGGS are our population. 

Let's mimick a study, draw a random sample of 100 children from this dataset, and compute the mean BMI in this sample.

```{r}
...
