Download this R Markdown file, save it on your computer, and perform all the below tasks by inserting your answer in text or by inserting R chunks below. After you are done, upload this file with your solutions on Moodle.

## Exercise 1: Probability distributions

Explore the functions *rnorm*, *rt*, *runif*, *rbinom* in R that allow you to generate random numbers from the normal, t-, uniform, and binomial distribution. Compute them with different values, and inspect histograms to visualize their distribution.

## Exercise 2: Odds ratio

In the KiGGS dataset:

a) Compute the proportion of mothers that had hypertension during pregnancy. Use the variable 'e0155' which has values "Ja" (yes), "Nein" (No) and "Wei√ü nicht" (don't know).
b) Create a new variable that is 0 or 1 depending on whether the children are small or tall (think of a good way how to do this) based on the variable 'groeB'. 
c) Then compute the odds ratio that the mother had hypertension during pregnancy (e0155 == "Ja", versus e0155 == "Nein") of tall vs. small children.

## Exercise 3 (optional): Confidence intervals

Look again at the hypertension variable from exercise 2. Use the binom::binom.confint and the questionr::odds.ratio functions to compute the estimates of the proportion and odds ratio as well as their confidence intervals. (you need to download and load these packages at first).

## Exercise 4 (optional, advanced): Bootstrap

Adapt the bootstrap implementation in R_5b_estimation_bootstrap.Rmd to compute the bootstrap estimate of the standard error of the variance of a normally-distributed and a t-distributed variable. Are they similar?
