## Exercise 1: Compute frequency tables in NoShow dataset

```{r}
# Load data
load(file = url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/32pyh375kjkqv14/NoShowdata.RData?dl=1"))

# Show the header of the data
# options(dplyr.width = Inf) # to show all columns
head(NoShowdata)

# Question 1: Which relevant variables are measured on a nominal scale?

# Question 2: Compute absolute and relative frequencies of these relevant nominal variables 

# Meaning?
# -> See also https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments

# Compute relative frequencies of the nominal variables
```


```{r}
# Question 3: Compute 2-way frequency tables of each variable with the NoShow variable (cross-tab, contingency table)

```

```{r}
# Question 4: Export these tables to xlsx files.

```

## Exercise 2: Compute frequency plots in the NoShow dataset and save them

```{r}
# Load data
load(file = url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/32pyh375kjkqv14/NoShowdata.RData?dl=1"))

# Compute barplots and mosaicplots of the No-Show variable as well as of other variables.

# Save these plots as pdf and jpeg files.

```

# Exercise 3: Descriptive statistics of ordinal and metric variables

```{r}
# Load data
load(file = url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/j50z4e17l5aabk8/Pima_diabetes.RData?dl=1"))
Pima_diabetes$Diabetes <- factor(Pima_diabetes$Outcome, labels = c("no", "yes"))

# Look at data
head(Pima_diabetes)

# Descriptive statistics of BMI: compute min, max, range, median, mad, mean, sd, variance, skewness and kurtosis of BMI

# Compute mean of BMI stratified by diabetes and stratified by Pregnancies using the 'tapply' function
```

# Exercise 4: Plots of ordinal and metric variables

```{r}
# Load data
load(file = url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/j50z4e17l5aabk8/Pima_diabetes.RData?dl=1"))
Pima_diabetes$Diabetes <- factor(Pima_diabetes$Outcome, labels = c("no", "yes"))

# Generate a histogram, boxplot, scatterplot, and normal quantile-quantile plot of BMI.
```
