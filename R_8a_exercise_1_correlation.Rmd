## Load KiGGS data

```{r}
#dat_link <- url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/nbh0f6upejh7nr8/data.RData?dl=1")
#load(dat_link)
load("C:/Users/stefan.konigorski/Desktop/data_Teaching/KiGGS/KiGGS03_06.RData")
dat <- KiGGS03_06
```

## Correlation

Choose 5 different variables and compute pairwise different correlation coefficients. Also look at scatterplots of the variables.

Also try to use the cor and plot for all 5 variables at once.

```{r}
...
```

Look at the results (correlation coefficients, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests), compare and interpret them.
